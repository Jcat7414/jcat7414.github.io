                <p>As the proud mother of two young adult children, Joy has enjoyed developing their 
                    love of travel, sharing the experience of new environments, cultures and 
                    opportunities to explore over 30 countries around the world.</p>
                <p>On realising that one of her children wanted to be a computer game developer, 
                    but did not have a peer group of friends to learn with, Joy set up CoderDojo 
                    Toowoomba. A club for children to learn how to become creators of technology.</p>

                        entrepreneurs, encouraging them to focus on a triple bottom line

                <h3>The Future</h3>
                <p>In mid 2020, Joy was successful in gaining a place in the She Codes Plus 
                    - Brisbane cohort. This six-month program gives 20 women the opportunity 
                    to learn together, as they work through the fun and frustrations of 
                    learning to code in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django and React, with the 
                    support of industry mentors and expert facilitators. The program has been 
                    supported by BHP and Spacecubed (Perth).</p> 
                <p>Learning to create with technology is a skill that Joy intends to develop 
                    into a career as a Software Engineer, using this knowledge to work with 
                    other like-minded people from around the world to create solutions to 
                    problems that she cares about, such as the education of women & girls, 
                    animal welfare and human impact on the environment.</p>
